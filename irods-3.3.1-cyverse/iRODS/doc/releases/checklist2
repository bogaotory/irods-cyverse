This is a description of the steps to be done to complete a release.
The first set (to the ---- line) can be done ahead of time but are
listed here to be re-checked.  See the checklist1 flie for a list of
tasks that should be done leading up to the release.

If not done before (as noted in checklist1), test one or
more patch files for Postgres, Oracle and/or MySQL; depending on the
complexity.

Run specNameTest.pl to test special names.  (This is not part of the
tinderbox tests but should succeed).

Check warning messages on other platforms (in addition to Ubuntu), if
there is time, and resolve them if straight-forward.

Change version number/month-yr in lib/core/include/rodsVersion.h.

Update the copyright date to include the current year in LICENSE.txt
and COPYRIGHT/Copyright.txt.

Check for updated scripts in the scripts/perl directory and update
version (date) in those changed.

Add new icommands (if any) to the ihelp.c list.

Need to include in the release_notes if old clients are compatible.  Check
and add a section (see previous release notes).

Check the INSTALL.txt file and update as needed for the current release.

Update the scripts/perl/irodssetup.pl for the patch notice.  These are
the printNotice text about 'When upgrading from' and they list release
numbers and specific instructions.  See the svn log messages and
history.

Update config/doxygen.config PROJECT_NUMBER (version) (or Terrell will)
  and doxygen-msi.config

  Some day it might be nice to include the other Doxygen documentaion
  (doxygen.config, the APIs etc) on the wiki, similar to the msi's, but
  currently we do not (see other Doxygen notes below).


--------------------------------------------
Make the release file:

Do an 'svn export', not co (starting with 2.3)
  'svn export svn://irodssvn.ucsd.edu/trunk'

Keep track of the revision numbers for the release (use to use 'cvs tag' so
  probably could for svn, but there was some issue with that, so just
  note the number):
      2.3 is r2515, 2.4 is 3188
      2.4.1 is 3458
      3.1 is 4882 -> 4887
      3.2 may be 5239 -> now 5240

Update time on (touch) rulegen.c to avoid a problem on some hosts
  where something tries to regenerate it.

3.0+: 
remove jargon and clients/prods trees (if they are still in svn)
For 3.3+:
remove jargon but not client/prods as prods is OK now with a README.txt that
  refers to the proper Gforge repository at code.renci.org for PHP.

tar cfz irods3.2.tgz iRODS
  or
  tar cf irods2.1.tar iRODS
  and then gzip 
--------------------------------------------

Move it /misc/www/projects/irods/cgi-bin on an SDSC host
(merrimac.sdsc.edu works)


update the cgi program to use new version.
 In /misc/www/projects/irods/cgi-bin (merrimac)
 copy upload8.c to upload9.c   (Numbers are larger now, use latest and
          copy the next number in sequence)
 build on merrimac
 gcc -o upload9.cgi upload9.c

In /misc/www/projects/irods
  ln -s download9.html download.html 

The Wiki page uses download.html so that should be sufficient.
  Sometime, we might try to rename so that it might not be cached

In the days following the release:

Update Doxygen files (gen on Pivo or maybe Zuri, 'ruby runDoxygen.rb',
   put all the generated files that are output into iRODS/doc/html
   into merrimac/misc/www/projects/irods/doxygen (tar and move).

   This is a subset of the Doxygen documention, just the
   micro-services.  There are two configuration files (see
   runDoxygen.rb) and the currently used one is
   ./config/doxygen-msi.config, and if instead we use the other,
   ./config/doxygen.config, much more is generated but with various
   errors.  But we seem to have Doxygen comment blocks for 412 functions
   but only 255 in the micro-service (used) msi set.

Build and update Mac-PowerPC and Mac-Intel download files
   (did 2.5 but hadn't 3.0, did Intel for 3.1 and 3.2 &they can ask for PowerPC)

Update i-cmd wiki help pages with new versions and new i-cmd pages.
   In many cases you can use the i-cmd -h (like 'iinit -h') text as
   the source text for the wiki page; this sometimes requires a little
   editing but is generally fairly close.

Update wiki Roadmap page
