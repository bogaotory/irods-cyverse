# HostAccessControl - The host based access configuration file.
#                     It is used only if the following hook is commented out in your core.re:
                      acChkHostAccessControl||msiCheckHostAccessControl|nop
#
# The first column specifies a user that is allowed to connect to
# this iRODS server. An entry of "all" means all users are allowed.
# The second column specifies the group name. An entry of "all" means, all groups are allowed.
# The third and fourth columns specify the address and the address mask.
# Together, they define the client IP addresses/domains that are permitted
# to connect to the iRODS server. The address column specifies the IP
# address and the Mask column specifies which bits will be ignored
# i.e., after those bits are taken out, the connection address 
# must match the address in the address column; that is if the bit is
# set in the mask, it will be ignored in the connecting address, so
# 255 means any value is allowed.
#
# In the the following example, only user 'rods' can connect (from any host).
# Since the mask bytes are 255, those are ignored and the 127.0.0.1 could be
# any legal IP address:
# <name>   <group>   <address>     <mask>
#rods all 127.0.0.1 255.255.255.255
#
# In the following example, any user can connect but only from one host:
#all all 137.110.243.161 0.0.0.0
